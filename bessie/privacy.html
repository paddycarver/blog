        <h1 class="huge clearfix">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="intro">This is your data, not ours.</p>
        <p>Giving us access to your data is a matter of trust, and we take that trust seriously. We've put together this policy to outline how your data will be used.</p>
        <h2>In Plain English</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Your data will only ever be used for your benefit.</strong> We are not looking to build a social graph that we can use to wield immense power over the internet. We are not trying to entice advertisers with increasingly identifying information about you and what you like. We're trying to build a useful tool. Your data will <em>only</em> be used to make that tool more useful <em>to you</em>. Not in a wishy-washy &quot;more money means more development time, which means a better product, so selling you like cattle is in your best interest&quot; way&mdash;in a &quot;we store the type of device that sent a link so we can appropriately identify it to you and properly focus our development efforts to take advantage of the devices our users are actually <em>using</em>&quot; way.</li>
          <li><strong>We'll never share your personal data without your permission.</strong> We're not interested in making a quick buck by telling the world what you're doing on the web. It just seems incredibly boring to us. We are, however, interested in helping people produce better content and gain insight about how their content is being shared; to that end, we reserve the right to share <em>anonymous</em>, <em>aggregated</em> information about the data in our system at our discretion. This does <em>not</em> mean we can say &quot;Oh yes, little Julie shared eighteen links to <a href="http://www.catsthatlooklikehitler.com" title="I can never get enough of that.">Cats That Look Like Hitler</a> last month&quot;, but it <em>does</em> mean we're comfortable saying &quot;<a href="http://www.xkcd.com" title="XKCD">XKCD</a> has been shared a bajillion and a half times this month by all our users&quot;.</li>
          <li><strong>Your information is your-eyes-only.</strong> We, our employees, our contractors, our in-laws, and our pets will never access your personal data unless it is directly pertinent to a support request. We're curious, nosy individuals, but we keep that in our personal lives. Your private information is not ours to peruse just because we're bored.</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy is not a feature, and it is not dependent on a check.</strong> Even if you leave 2cloud, cancel your account, or default on payments, we'll still respect your right to privacy. You are paying us for a tool, not for your privacy using that tool. The only way to waive your right to privacy is to actually waive your right to privacy, in writing.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete actually means delete.</strong> When you delete your account, it will be gone. We will keep it around for a few days, to make sure you <em>really, really</em> wanted to delete it and didn't just fat-finger a button, but after that it will be wiped from existence. All your links will be deleted at that time. <strong>Note:</strong> Links are stored in our database twice: once as the link's actual URL, and once as a reference to that URL every time the link is shared. When you delete a link or your account, you will <em>always</em> delete the reference, which is the only piece that ties the link to your account. Furthermore, if you're the only person who has shared that link at the time of deletion, the URL itself will be removed from our system, as well. Delete simply means that, as far as our system is concerned, you never shared the link at all. (Our aggregated, anonymous metrics will retain some information after deletion; these are anonymous to such a degree that they should not impact specific user privacy. In the unlikely scenario that they do, please <a href="/contact" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> and we will remove the information.)</li>
          <li><strong>Common sense trumps all else.</strong> At the end of the day, our privacy policy is ruled by common sense. Even if, technically, our privacy policy allowed us to sell your email to spammers (it doesn't), we <em>know</em> that's not how you meant us to use that information, so we're not going to do that. On the flip side of that coin, even if our privacy policy said we can't look at your information without your permission (it does), if you engage us in a support request saying &quot;this link keeps opening in my browser, make it stop&quot;, we're not going to email you back and say &quot;is it okay if we look into that?&quot; That would be just silly and would introduce an unnecessary delay into <em>getting your problem fixed</em>. The permission to look into it is implied in that situation. At the end of the day, it all comes down to bullet 1: if it will help you have a good experience, we'll do it. Otherwise, we won't.</li>
          <li><strong>We're afraid of court.</strong> If we are legally obligated to share your information, we will. We will not do so at the drop of a hat; officials will need to follow proper protocol and we will have to be <em>obligated</em>, not <em>asked</em>. But if you are a political dissident, if you are engaging in legally gray activities, or you are breaking the law, we suggest you host your own data. It's not that we don't agree with your cause or what you're doing (we don't know what you're doing), and it's not that we don't like free speech, but we're a small team with limited resources. Our resources are better spent building an amazing product than trying to sustain an expensive court battle. <strong>Note:</strong> this is the only part of this policy we retain the right to ignore on a whim. If we are ordered to divulge your information at a time when we have the resources to fight it and we believe your information is protected under the first amendment, we reserve the right to endure a lengthy, expensive court battle over it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Don't Trust Us Unless You <em>Really</em> Want To</h2>
        <p>We know sharing an explicit log of your browsing habits with us is a huge leap of faith to be taking, so we do what we can to reassure you. Sometimes, though, our efforts aren't enough, and we know that. We've developed two alternatives for people who still don't trust us, because <em>you shouldn't have to.</em></p>
        <h3>Run Your Own Server</h3>
        <p>2cloud is 100% <a href="https://github.com/2cloud" title="2cloud on Github">open source software</a>; you can download the source code and build your own server, if you like. We'll even help you, if you need it. Even better, you won't have to pay our monthly fee. On the downside, you will have to pay for your own hosting and do your own maintenance. If you're already doing that, though, this should be a pretty feasible option for you. If you do this, we don't have any access to your information <em>at all</em>. It's like we aren't even part of your life (but do keep in touch; we'd like to be part of your life, even if you don't trust us).</p>
        <h3>Encrypt Your Links</h3>
        <p>Our clients support an encryption setting that allows you to encrypt your links with a password before sending them to our server. If you take advantage of this, we will have no idea what links you're sending. Nobody will, unless they have the password. On the downside, this is kind of a pain and a little dangerous. First, you need to enter the same password into every single client that you connect to our service, or they'll be annoying and prompt you for the password every time they get an encrypted link. Second, you'll be unable to view the links in our web interface unless you enter the encryption password. Finally, if you ever forget that password, there's nothing we can do for you. Your link history will be gone, barring a successful brute-force attack against your encryption password. You're welcome to try that, but we can't help you with it.</p>
