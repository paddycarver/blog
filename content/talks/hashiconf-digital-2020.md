summary: A brief history of notable events in Terraform provider development, this talk shows both how many patterns provider developers rely on are newer than they'd think, but also that the fundamental abstractions provider developers use have been around a lot longer than they'd think.

I was fortunate enough to be able to give a lightning talk on the history of
Terraform provider development, a subject I find endlessly fascinating, with my
coworker [Katy Moe](https://katy.moe) at HashiConf Digital 2020. It was an
interesting experience doing a lightning talk with someone on a different
continent over a Zoom call, but Katy was an amazing co-presenter and I'm really
pleased with how it turned out.

We discussed the major inflection points in the history of the six year old
framework that powers Terraform provider development, and drew attention to how
new some features were and how many abstractions predated the features they now
surface to the user.

A recording of the session is embedded below.
