This is a talk I gave at [Ignite Buffalo](http://www.ignitebuffalo.com), largely because I wanted to make the reference to [René Magritte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte) and [The Treachery of Images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images).

The talk walks through my experiences with Hacker News comments, and sums up why they’re terrible. It suggests ways to avoid them. And most of all, it serves as a reminder to [Make Good Art](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikAb-NYkseI).

You can see a great [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8DvxT1W6cHI) of the talk. Ignore my “ummmm”s and “like”s.
