A talk I gave with my friend Dana Hoffman, of Google, about the [Magic
Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules) project, how we
were using it with Terraform, the new possibilities it opened up, and a brief
history of the GCP provider for Terraform. We also talked about how our two
companies worked together.
