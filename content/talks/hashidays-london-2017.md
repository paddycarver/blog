I was invited to give a talk on multi-cloud strategies using Terraform and
Nomad at HashiDays London. In my talk, I talk through why you may want to
deploy to multiple clouds, and do a live demo of deploying a Nomad cluster to
Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, all using Terraform.

You can find the code used in the talk [on
GitHub](https://github.com/paddycarver/hashidays-london).
