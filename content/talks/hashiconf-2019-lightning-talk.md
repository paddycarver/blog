The HashiCorp community team asked if I'd do a lightning talk about the history
of HashiCorp's popular pride stickers, which I'd had a hand in creating in
2017. I was delighted to, and got to talk on a stage for several minutes about
representation in the workplace and how we can use symbols to make space for
others.

I was fortunate enough to be able to reprise this talk at the Seattle HUG a
couple days later.

You can find the slides for this talk
[online](https://talks.paddy.io/Pride.pdf) and my husband recorded a video of
it on his phone, which you can find embedded below.
