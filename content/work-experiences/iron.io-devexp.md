After contracting with Iron.io for a bit, I signed on as a full-time employee to be their first [Developer Experience Engineer](/posts/developer-experience-engineer). I worked to build the [Dev Center](https://dev.iron.io/) and to understand how our customers were using our products and build a better experience for them. This involved attending a lot of hackathons and [giving talks](/talks/kick-more-apm) I also maintained several of our client libraries for our APIs, in multiple different languages.
