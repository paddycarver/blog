I joined HashiCorp, a company creating open source infrastructure tooling and selling enterprise versions of it, as a Software Engineer to work on [Terraform](https://terraform.io), an infrastructure-as-code tool. I quickly gravitated towards the [Google Cloud Platform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google), taking the lead on it for HashiCorp's side. This involved working on the provider, but also involved collaborating with [our partners at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f-t0xIJvd4) who also had full-time engineers contributing to the provider as co-equal maintainers.

I also led the development of [a GitHub bot](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-hashibot-github-bot) to help manage our open source repositories and spent some time as the primary maintainer of both the official providers for [Nomad](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/nomad) and [Vault](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault). I also [spoke](/talks/hashidays-london-2017) at HashiDays London about using Nomad and Terraform together.
