Ok, so pretty much anyone who’s tech-savvy knows by now that Twitter has started “embedding” ads in its search results. Embedding is in quotes because Twitter will say it’s the wrong word. They like “promoting”.

In a system it calls “promoted tweets”, it lets advertisers pay to have their tweets promoted in places like searches and in their followers streams--or so far as I’ve understood, at least. Granted, I don’t understand much about this new revenue system, and I don’t really care to; an odd approach, given the post title. Let me explain.

I’m not so much saying that you should support Twitter and its ads; instead, I’m saying that applications should. Twitter made the risky decision to not require its third-party clients to include the promoted tweets, and to split the revenue with them. Meaning if a developer doesn’t want to display ads in their application, they don’t have to. Which is admirable.

And yet, I’m claiming that developers _should_ include these promoted tweets in their application. And here’s why: it isn’t the developer’s choice.

Ads have a really negative stigma associated with them today, and for good reason: most suck and are annoying. We need to keep in mind the point of advertising, however: to make us buy things. And so long as we aren’t being _tricked_ into buying things, one would imagine that we’d actually _want_ what we’re buying. This is what the whole industry is built on. Advertising is simply the business of bringing a user and the product they want together. Everyone wins.

Most users, however, don’t want to see these promoted tweets. Why? I don’t care. Honestly, it’s superfluous to my argument, a tangent that only breeds trouble. I don’t know enough about the system to argue it effectively. But I _do_ know that if I’m a user, there’s a _chance_ that I may enjoy these ads, they may work for me, or hell, that I may want to support Twitter. And why should the developer of the application I’m _choosing_ to use make that decision for me? With Twitter launching its own official clients, developers can’t afford to estrange users by making decisions for the user.

So yes, I support Twitter’s Ads. I’ll be asking @funkatron if we can include them in @spaz. But, to be perfectly clear: I support including them as an option. A check box in the settings page. Let the user decide.
