I started out to write this post thinking I hadn’t written anything for this site in quite some time. Actually, I wrote a post here four days ago. Seems like that was a long time ago. Probably because I’ve done so much in between then and now. My last post was on Tuesday; let’s recap what has happened since then.

## Tuesday

Tuesday was the introduction of [Neil Patrick Harris](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000439/ "The man, the legend, the god.") to [Glee](http://www.fox.com/glee/ "Guilty Secret: I *adore* Kurt."). I’m not much of a television person; Glee’s the only show I watch regularly. And NPH happens to be my personal hero.

Naturally, I set up a projector to view the show. And naturally, I almost wet myself. I was extremely disappointed that the producers saw fit to auto-tune NPH (who _does_ that?!), but it was still amazing to see him rock out to Dream On and Piano Man.

## Wednesday

Wednesday I dedicated to [Google I/O](http://code.google.com/io "I will attend this before I die."). I watched the [recorded versions](http://www.youtube.com/googledevelopers "Almost as good. Almost.") of the streams as soon as I got the chance, and thought and thought some more about [the company I want to work for](http://www.suchagit.com/ "I’m really bad about this shameless self-promotion thing."). Day 1, I thought, was far more web-oriented. It was all about building web applications: HTML5, cloud computing, app stores, etc. Day 2, to the contrary, I saw as being far more focused on devices; namely, [Android](http://www.android.com/ "I wish I had one of these phones.") and [Google TV](http://www.google.com/tv "Another consumer device with Google in front of it. I’m waiting for Google Refrigerator.").

I’m squeeing like a schoolgirl over Google TV, because I may actually watch TV again now. Ignoring the fact that _I don’t have the time for it_, this is really exciting. And Android was exciting, for reasons I’ll cover in a minute.

## Thursday

Thursday was also dedicated to I/O. I’ve only seen the first half (before the Google TV news) due to availability, but Android already has me super pumped. The cloud to Android sync option (the Push notification done right, as it were) particularly inspired me. It inspired me so much that on…

## Friday

I started a [new project](http://www.suchagit.com/2010/05/android-to-cloud-push.html "I needed another one, right?"), [android2cloud](http://code.google.com/p/android2cloud/ "This has been remarkably well-received."). I figured if the cloud could push pages to Android, Android should be able to push back.

I was in Rochester for the day, at my brother’s commencement, but in the four hour round-trip and an hour or so after the event, I managed to get a working prototype of the cloud side of this. A Chrome extension pings an App Engine server every 15 seconds and gets the latest link attached to your Google Account (using OAuth, of course). If that link is the same as the last link that Chrome opened, Chrome does nothing. If it’s different, Chrome opens it in a new tab. There’s also a button in the browser that will open the last link attached to your account, no matter what.

I plan to release two versions of the Android app when I (start and) finish it: a free version, and a $0.99 version. These two versions will be absolutely identical in every way. The only difference is one donates $0.99 to me to help me get through college, and (maybe? Possibly? No promises.) send me to I/O next year. Basically, it’s a convenient way to donate to me.

Of course, I need to _have_ an Android app to sell, and I haven’t even started yet. I want to wait until I have an Android phone I can actually test it on (though I have a pretty good theory as to how the app will work…) Which leads me to…

## Today

Today, the glorious day in which I bought my [Nexus One](http://www.google.com/phone "Prediction: http://www.google.com/microwave. Make yourself a frozen dinner FROM THE CLOUD!"). It will arrive Monday or Tuesday. I’m excited.

I also did some work on android2cloud, designing logos, opening sites, and checking policies. I have a request in to Google to use the word "android" in my application, as well as to allow me to use my modified copy of the Android logo in situations where it’s impossible or impractical to include their attribution statement at the bottom of a page. Like, for example, in the app, in Chrome, in [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/android2cloud "This basically serves as an underhanded way to let me promote the project with every link it possesses."), and in [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/android2cloud "Though as long as you’re reading these mouse-overs, why not join the group?"). Basically, everywhere I use the icon. I feel like Google will come through for me, so long as I attribute them somehow.

So yeah, busy week. And it looks like my next week is bright: [Lady GaGa is on Glee](http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/glee-first-look-lady-gaga-tribute-clip-and-pics.html "This ranks right up there with NPH being on Glee."), I get my Nexus One, and I get to see [an improv show my friends are performing in](http://satanslemonade.tumblr.com/ "No, seriously, they’re hilarious. If you’re in Syracuse, go watch.").

I love summer.
