I should be writing a paper right now. Two, actually. But a book review of [Go To](http://www.amazon.com/Engineers-Scientists-Iconoclasts-Programmers-Revolution/dp/0465042260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271365342&amp;sr=8-1 "Surprisingly, very inspiring and informational. I recommend it. Maybe not highly, but still a recommended read.") is nowhere near as interesting, and a response to [Shameful Flight](http://www.amazon.com/Shameful-Flight-Years-British-Empire/dp/0195393945/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271365296&amp;sr=8-1 "It was a terrible book. Don’t read it.") is far too tedious. So, in a true return to my past, I’m writing a blog post instead of worrying about schoolwork. Such is life.

I started my life as a hacker playing with JavaScript on [ProBoards](http://www.proboards.com "It’s still a shame to admit this."). But my true immersion into the world of hacking and programming came when I took up Linux, inspired by my programming mentor Bob Duke, and formed the Linux Campaign in my high school. As a LUG, the Linux Campaign was a bust. But it was fun. And I found something out:

I really enjoy Open Source software.

The [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html "I’m liberal. I’m the first to admit it."), the [MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License "Sorry, only a Wikipedia page."), the [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org "Moving away from my ideals, but still wonderful.")… these are my licenses. [Free Culture](http://www.free-culture.cc "The phenomenal treatise by Lawrence Lessig. Go read it now. Even if you already have. NOW.") is my bible. And yet… in the past few years, I’ve been drifting away from <abbr title="Free Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr>. Not intentionally, and not significantly. I still prefer FOSS products, when I can find them. I still use [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org "OK, in honesty, I’ve been drifting more towards Python lately. I can’t help it. It’s prettier.") and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com "Even if I am still an amateur.") to make stuff, and still don’t care if other people use my stuff.

But I guess that’s the issue. I don’t care.

Part of the culture surrounding FOSS is the _desire_ to share. The _desire_ to help others use your work, to contribute back to the community. And the community gives me so much, it’s hard to justify not giving back. To be honest, for the last year or two, I’ve been a leech on the FOSS community. I’ve been busy, yes, but so are @funkatron, and @felixge, and all the other FOSS contributors that I admire and strive to emulate. And I’d like to change that.

I’m starting this summer by applying to [GSoC](http://socghop.appspot.com "Google Summer of Code"). If accepted, I’ll be working on either [Melange](http://code.google.com/p/soc "The Spice of Creation") or [Big Blue Button](http://www.bigbluebutton.org "Very relevant to my actual JOB. So everyone wins!") for the summer, contributing Open Source Code. Last night, I also attended a @spaz meeting, and signed up as a contributer to the wonderful FOSS.

So here it is, FOSS community: my apology to you. And my promise to make amends.
