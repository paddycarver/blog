For over a year now, I’ve been part of [EngineYard](http://engineyard.com)’s amazing [Prompt](http://prompt.engineyard.com) program. I’ve given a series of talks and been on a series of panels because of this program, but I realised this week that I’ve never made a formal offer on the subject. So here it is.

I will come to your offices, to your team-building exercise, to your user group, to your conference. I will come prepared with a talk, or be there to do a brief overview of my experiences and then answer questions and just hold a discussion. If you are in Manhattan, Queens, or Brooklyn, I will get myself to your event and it will cost you nothing. If you are outside those areas, try to pick up the flights and room, if you can. If it is absolutely not in your budget, we can speak to Prompt about covering them.

I will give you my time and talk about things that make me feel vulnerable and weak, because it is important that we do this. We talk about physical health in the workplace all the time. Employers sponsor gym memberships, and have physical health months. But we never talk about mental health. It’s hard. It’s not comfortable. But it’s important.

I want to help you start a conversation about mental health. Please reach out if you’re interested.

About me:

* I have been speaking about this for over a year. You can see [some of my talks](/talks).
* I’m certified in [Mental Health First Aid](http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org).
* **I am not a mental health professional**. I write code all day. I am here to start the conversation, but I cannot diagnose people, be a therapist, prescribe medication, or give you answers. I can instead point you to people who can and resources. I can only tell you about what does and does not work for me.
