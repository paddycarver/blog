When I was in high school, I was a smart kid.

I don't mean that I was special, or that I was superior in some way to my classmates. I just mean that I was pretty good at taking tests, and was interested in the things we talked about in school, even if I wasn't super interested in pursuing those topics in the way my teachers had in mind. And altogether, this added up to the adults in my life labeling me as a "smart kid".

Because I am An Old, this was all happening while Wikipedia was in its ascendancy. And as they were teaching us to write, we were being taught to cite our sources. We were told Wikipedia wasn't a credible source, and that domains that end in ".org" and ".edu" are credible, as are domains that have things like "Journal" in their name.

My interest in the internet had already been established by this point, and I already owned a couple domains. So I quietly registered a silly .org domain, and in my next paper, handed it in with citations including LiveJournal.com and my own .org domain. I like to think the teacher was amused, even though my marks for the paper suffered.

As we talk about fake news, as we talk about organizations that lie to us, I keep thinking back to how we were told not to cite Wikipedia, because it isn't reliable. And how that's where the conversation about citations began and ended. We were told we needed a certain number of citations, and so treated them as an afterthought, something to be sprinkled over the completed essay to check off all the requirements. Our citations education revolved around the specific formats that organizations published, and I earned a fair bit of gratitude from my friends for pointing them to online tools that would format citations in the appropriate format automatically--tools that were novel at the time.

But we never really addressed citations as a matter of trust. We never talked about why sites with "Journal" in their name or that end in ".org" are more likely to be reliable--and when they're not, as my smart-ass stunt proved. We certainly never got into whether you should distrust an otherwise reliable source--like a government website--when it's not neutral. And we definitely never addressed how to follow the trail of facts from an unknown source, the reliability of which we don't know, and decide for ourselves whether it's reliable or not.

As we enter an age of unreliable sources and misinformation being presented to us at every turn, it feels like the conversations we grew up with about reliability and trust were insufficient. And maybe they've changed in the last decade. I hope they have. But I fear we're still focusing on demonising Wikipedia and making sure everything is MLA formatted while failing to address why we cite in the first place, and how to evaluate information you come across.

Just feels like a missed opportunity to help us get out of this mess.
