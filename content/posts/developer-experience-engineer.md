Just over six months ago, I started working at [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io) 
as a software engineering intern. I quickly diverged from my intended purpose, 
though, mainly because I’m really bad at following instructions.

As of today, I’ve been upgraded to full employee status, with a title change 
that more accurately describes what I do. I’ve become their first Developer 
Experience Engineer.

I know, I know. What the hell? That’s the wankiest title I’ve ever heard of. 
But it’s actually pretty accurate. My job at Iron.io is to do anything I 
can to make sure that people who develop on our platform have the best possible 
experience. That is my responsibility. It manifests itself mainly in the 
ongoing work I’m doing with our [Dev Center](http://dev.iron.io), but it has 
developer outreach parts, it has higher level strategy parts, it has a lot of 
connotations that come with it. It means I offer feedback and suggestions on 
new products. It means I write client libraries and examples. If something 
will make using Iron.io’s services easier, more enjoyable, or more effective 
for our customers, I’m supposed to be doing it or helping someone else do it.

That’s a tall order. The job is modeled heavily after Developer Evangelists 
and Developer Advocates, but with a more holistic approach.

I wanted to take a moment to lay out the principles that I hold above all 
others for this job, as I think they explain things a lot better than I can:

* **Never sell anyone anything**. I have [been accused](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4059780) 
  of blatantly advertising Iron.io’s products. I want to make a promise, 
  right now, that I will *never* try to do this. I do not believe that the 
  cloud is for *everyone*. I do not believe that Iron.io can solve every 
  problem. I do not believe that getting a user to sign up under false 
  pretenses is a good thing. Iron.io’s services are all pay-per-use. That 
  means if you stop using them, we stop getting paid. Even if I trick you 
  into signing up, you’re going to figure out pretty quickly that the solution 
  isn’t right for you. We’re going to lose you as a customer and will have 
  most likely made *nothing*. You’re going to tell Twitter and Facebook and 
  Google+ about how our products suck, because you’re not using them in the 
  right situation. Nobody wins. Instead, I’m going to try to help the people 
  whose problems *can* be solved by Iron.io’s tools to solve their problems. 
  They get a solved problem, we get a happy customer, everyone wins. Doesn’t 
  that seem like a much more enjoyable job to you? Me too. That’s the job I’m 
  going to do.
* **You owe us nothing**. If you aren’t reading our documentation, it’s 
  because our docs are too boring and dry. Or maybe they need better navigation. 
  Or maybe they should be more interactive. The point is, you have a choice 
  in who you host your software with. If we don’t make it as easy as possible 
  for you, you’re going to go to someone who will. Plain and simple. “The 
  developer should do more work” is not a valid answer, no matter what the 
  problem is. Using our services is supposed to make your life easier, not 
  trade out your old work and annoyances for new work and annoyances.
* **I’m not too busy for you**. I don’t care if you’re from a one-man shop 
  doing a weekend hack or if you’re Google. If you need help, you deserve 
  nothing less than the best assistance I can offer you. Sometimes that may 
  not be enough. That’s regrettable, but inevitable. I’m a limited human 
  with limited time. My inbox will always have room for developers who need 
  help, I will always do my best to respond on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/paddycarver) 
  or [Google+](http://profiles.google.com/foran.paddy), and I will do my best 
  to ensure that no question is met with silence in Iron.io’s [public support 
  chat room](http://get.iron.io/chat). I can’t build a better developer 
  experience if I don’t know what developers are experiencing.

I’m very excited to continue my efforts at this, even as the daunting size 
and scope of the job intimidates me. I hope that my efforts in the next six 
months will help to make me more available to you and will help to make you 
more productive at what you do.

An intuitive and adaptive product renders examples unnecessary. Illustrative 
examples render documentation unnecessary. Clear, concise, and useful documentation 
renders a support channel unnecessary. A support channel makes sure that all 
other failings do not leave anyone stranded.
