I’m pretty fortunate. In fact, I’m doubly fortunate.

Not only was I invited to [Google+](http://plus.google.com "Google+") when the only way to get in was to have a Googler personally recommend you, I was invited _twice_. How’s that for bragging rights? When everyone was begging for these invites, I had _two_.

But enough of me bragging about my random luck that has absolutely nothing to do with my own skill or worthiness. I’ve [seen a lot of people](http://twitter.com/jezdez/status/86344633973620737 "Tweet from jezdez on Twitter") comparing Buzz and Google+. Or [comparing Facebook and Google+](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/google-takes-on-facebook-zyngas-ipo-advances-twitters-stone-steps-back-sprints-hesse-throws-nukes/2011/06/28/AGlFCMqH_blog.html "The Washington Post’s coverage of Google+"). The general consensus seems to be “I’ve seen this before.”

_Well no shit._

Google+ isn’t radically new like Wave was… which is probably for the best. Instead, it takes a bunch of things we’re already used to (photo sharing, update streams, tagging friends) and puts a Google spin on them (I, personally, love Sparks—Google’s way of making it convenient to introduce new content into your stream).

What I find interesting (and mildly amusing) is the comparisons that people are making. I’ve said that [Buzz is to Twitter as Google+ is to Facebook](http://twitter.com/paddycarver/status/86345726984077313 "Tweet from paddycarver on Twitter"). But that is really missing the point. There are two names missing from that analogy that should be there: [Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com "Jaiku") and [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com "Orkut"). Jaiku was Google’s first attempt at a Twitter clone—to be perfectly accurate, it wasn’t Google’s; they bought it. Orkut was Google’s first stab at a ~~Facebook clone~~. As Jason points out below, I was mistaken. Orkut was Google’s first stab at a _Friendster_ clone after [Friendster refused to sell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut#History_of_Orkut "History of Orkut on Wikipedia") to them. Facebook, as it turns out, was an iteration on Friendster (see [The Facebook Effect](http://books.google.com/books?id=RRUkLhyGZVgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false "The Facebook Effect on Google Books"), page 86: “’We were really worried we would be another Friendster,’ recalls Dustin Moskovitz”). Which, all-in-all, I think serves my point more than it hurts it, but in the spirit of absolute accuracy, I’ve amended the post. Good catch, Jason.

You’ve never heard of either of these, and if you have, you don’t use them. And that’s why they aren’t being placed in the analogies. That’s why they aren’t being mentioned at all.

It’s important to remember, though, that Google [believes in iteration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lX2KfGL80g "Mike Cassidy of Google on Product Iteration on YouTube"). I don’t think that just means iteration on a single product; I think that means iteration on their entire approach to a market segment.

I don’t know if Google+ is going to catch hold. I don’t know if it will go the way of Buzz, or go the way of GMail. I [hope it works](https://plus.google.com/112924888792635085586/posts/fNRhV5AeJaw" title="Post from Paddy Foran on Google+"). It’s too early to tell, though, despite [“insane demand”](https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/PhJFJqLyRnm "Post from Vic Gundotra on Google+"). What I do know is that [social is important to Google](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-memo-telling-all-google-employees-their-2011-pay-depends-on-google-sucking-less-at-social-2011-4 "Here’s The Memo Telling ALL Google Employees Their 2011 Pay Depends On Google Sucking Less At Social"). And as a company with nearly bottomless pockets, Google has all the time and cash it needs to iterate through product after product, learning as they go. Is Google+ the end of their quest for social? Only time will tell. If it’s not, are they going to give up? I doubt it.

So yes, you’ve seen this before. And rest assured, if it fails you’ll see it again. But failing to see what Google has learned as it has iterated over social products is failing to see Google for what it is: constantly improving, slowly but surely.
