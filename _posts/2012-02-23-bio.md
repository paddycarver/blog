title: Nice To Meet You
---

My name's Paddy Foran. I live in Buffalo, New York. I [write software]({{ site.baseurl }}/code "My Github Repository"), 
give [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks "My presentations"), and work for [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io "Iron.io"), 
where we're working hard to build the cloud so you don't have to. (Don't think poorly of them just because of 
little old me, though&mdash;they're wonderful people who were just silly enough to hire me. My opinions and crude language 
are my own, void where prohibited by law, et cetera, et cetera.)

I don't know much about you, but I'm willing to bet I've offended you in some way, shape, or form already. And if I haven't, 
well, I probably will soon. I don't mind all that much, and I hope you don't, either.
