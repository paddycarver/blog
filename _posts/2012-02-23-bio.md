summary: The mundane biography of someone you probably care nothing about.

My name&rsquo;s Paddy Foran. I live in Brooklyn, New York. I [write software](https://github.com/paddyforan "My Github account"), give [talks](/talks), and am a huge fanboy of the Open Web and companies that support it.

I love ridiculous adventures, unique experiences, and good software. I try to measure whether something&rsquo;s worth doing or not by whether or not it would make a good story, because I get bored easily.

I started the [Gets By](http://getsby.co) project because I think mental illness is something we should talk about.

My passion is for fulfilling experiences with products, and I strive to craft software that creates those experiences. My greatest fear is that a user will approach me and ask why my software made their life harder than it had to be, and I won&rsquo;t have a good answer for them.

I&rsquo;m friendly. I don&rsquo;t bite. Feel free to say hi.
