My name's Paddy Foran. I live in Buffalo, New York. I [write software](https://github.com/paddyforan "My Github Repository"), 
give [talks](/talks), and work for [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io "Iron.io"), 
where we're working hard to build the cloud so you don't have to. (Don't think poorly of them just because of 
little old me, though&mdash;they're wonderful people who were just silly enough to hire me. My opinions and crude language 
are my own, void where prohibited by law, et cetera, et cetera.)

I'm also a co-founder of [Second Bit](http://www.secondbit.org "Second Bit"), a modest little startup that makes cloud software 
with some personality. We're best known for [2cloud](http://www.2cloud.org "2cloud"), our Android app/Chrome extension double-whammy 
that makes it simple to move links from your phone to your computer.

I don't know much about you, but I'm willing to bet I've offended you in some way, shape, or form already. And if I haven't, 
well, I probably will soon. I don't mind all that much, and I hope you don't, either.

As it turns out, I'm a [pretty opinionated](/posts "My posts") guy. I think that colour has a &quot;u&quot;, 
I think you don't deserve to live if you don't use the Oxford comma, and I think [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org "The biggest piece of bloat ever") 
should be euthanised. I believe [Go](http://www.golang.org "The Jesus language") to be the One True Language, and if you think 
butchering the English language because you're lazy is okay, I probably fantasise about your death.

If you can get past all that, though, I'm unashamedly silly, have it on good authority that I &quot;don't suck too badly&quot;, and 
have heard several times that I'm &quot;pretty okay&quot;. So you should imitate a group of sharks that has spotted easy prey and 
[circle me](http://profiles.google.com/foran.paddy "My Google+ account") or at the very least [follow me](http://www.twitter.com/paddyforan "My Twitter account").
