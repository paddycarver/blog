In August, I was fortunate enough to be invited to [EngineYard](http://engineyard.com)&rsquo;s [Distill](http://distill.engineyard.com) conference in San Francisco to speak about my experiences with mental illness.

The talk was sponsored by EngineYard&rsquo;s [Prompt](http://prompt.engineyard.com) program, which sponsors almost all my talks on mental illness in tech. I can&rsquo;t give them enough credit for this program.

If you aren&rsquo;t following [Prompt on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MHPrompt), you should be. And if you&rsquo;re not certified in [Mental Health First Aid](http://mentalhealthfirstaid.org) (I am!), you totally should be. It&rsquo;s absolutely worth your time. You&rsquo;ll use it.

A video of the panel is available [on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/105802592).
