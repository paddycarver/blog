title: In Defence Of The Hackathon
summary: "I believe that hackathons are some of the most important events in our community, and I&apos;m afraid they&apos;re going the way of the dinosaur."

As part of [my role](/posts/developer-experience-engineer) at [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io), I attend a lot of hackathons. I have a special place in my heart for these events; they&apos;re precisely the type of event I would have loved to attend in college or high school, if I had had the opportunity to do so. But I didn&apos;t. My hacking was limited to sitting alone, in my room, staring at a screen and pushing bytes until things worked. And while that was incredibly formative for me and a great way to learn, it didn&apos;t really connect me to a community. It was accutely a solo activity for me.

Hackathons are different, though. In the last fifteen hours, I&apos;ve formed part of a &quot;[#swagboat](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23swagboat)&quot; (which, for the uninitiated, is a group of people sitting on wheelie chairs, forming a conga line that rolls around distributing swag), judged a dance competition (in which there was very little _dancing_, if we&apos;re to be discerning), and now I am reclining in front of a surprisingly soothing video of a fireplace projected on a monitor, surrounded by hackers. As I blog, someone in front of me is hacking together a pong game that replaces the ball with [Nyan Cat](http://youtu.be/QH2-TGUlwu4) and is likely to induce seizures. I spent a few minutes discussing the merits of [distributed hash tables](http://secondbit.org/blog/introducing-pastry) with a hacker who wants to try to create a distributed network of Android devices. Fellow evangelists discussed the finer points of evangelism with me, and we engaged in some friendly ribbing (I met a developer that uses Windows. No, seriously. He even booted it to prove it to me.) A developer just walked up to me and is explaining how he is _writing an assembler for the CPU he made up four hours ago_. I wish I were joking.

Last week, I met more tech talent _in my hometown_ than I thought existed. I met a [group of hackers](http://foss.rit.edu) that reminded me of my love for open source and taught me a bunch of cool new tricks.

I made new friends. I always make new friends at these events. These are my people. The silly, the exuberant, the _fun_. The people who love to build, and who build for no reason other than the joy they get out of it.

Every time I hear the term &quot;business plan&quot; at a hackathon, I die a little on the inside.

There&apos;s nothing wrong with business plans. There&apos;s nothing wrong with building a sustainable business in a weekend. I have a great respect for Startup Weekend events and events like them, but I also have a deep respect for hackathons. And I humbly submit that the two are different.

A hackathon is an event about _fun_. It is supposed to embody the spirit of a hack: something cool that is made for the sheer joy of making it. Something that may not be useful right now, but is still cool technology. A lot of our current computing culture was defined by hacks that had no immediately obvious use case.

More importantly, the joy of creating is a strong part of our culture right now. And I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s a part of our culture that is being edged out by the recent focus on _business_. The rest of the world figured out that technology is valuable and can create a lot of wealth quickly, and we started to lose sight of tech for the sake of tech. We started to lose sight of the fun-loving, prank-playing, unabashedly-silly culture we have inherited from the True Hackers Of Old&trade;. The people you read about in [a Steven Levy book](http://amzn.com/1449388396).

That&apos;s a terrible thing for us to lose.

So please, the next time you find yourself at a hackathon, stop focusing on your business plan. Stop trying to build something you can go home and use today. Build something that you&apos;re going to _have fun building_. And if you&apos;ve never been to a hackathon, please come to one. And bring your sense of fun.
