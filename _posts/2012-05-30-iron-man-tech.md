It is no secret that, ever since I joined up with [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io), 
I've been mildly obsessed with Iron Man. AC/DC has re-entered my daily 
soundtrack, I watch *Iron Man 2* on Netflix far more often than I should, 
and I've been known to subtly quote the movies in casual conversation. My 
fascination with the movies can be easily explained: they appeal to my brand 
of humour.

But there's something else, too: the tech in the movies is something I dream 
about. When I imagine the future of technology, that's what I imagine. This 
talk examines the tech they use and how we can get it in the future.

The talk is split into two parts: the overarching ideas begin the talk. These 
are the fortune cookies of the talk, the big ideas encompassed into a small 
phrase. These are followed by a UI examination, based off the concept art 
released by [Jayse](http://cargocollective.com/jayse/Avengers) from *The 
Avengers*. I also talk about why I'm less-than-impressed with the recently-announced 
[Leap](http://www.leapmotion.com) system and Disney Research's [Touch&eacute;](http://www.disneyresearch.com/research/projects/hci_touche_drp.htm) 
system.

The things I cover in this talk are things I've picked up over my years in 
the tech industry. They do not necessarily apply to one, or any, of the 
companies I work for or have worked for. My opinions, as always, are my own.

You can find the slides [on Google Presentations](http://xn--bih.tk/H0Nj).
