I'm considering moving my personal site over to [Github pages](http://pages.github.com) to be powered by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/). I like the capability to write my posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/tools/markdown) and the free, reliable hosting that Github provides. I like the flexibility of the templating engine. Most of the restrictions and limitations of Jekyll are things that I won't miss, anyways.

The fact that categories and tags aren't as useful hurts. The insistence upon including dates in the filenames hurts. But Jekyll has so many features I like, I can't see trading all of those for categories, posts, and filenames. I don't know, it just seems like the pros far outweigh the cons.

This does mean, of course, that I have to make my own template. That's the primary point of this post: testing it. I'm not a designer, but hopefully I didn't embarrass myself too badly with this attempt. I wanted something *green*.
