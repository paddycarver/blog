That&rsquo;s an excerpt from [Then you should do it.](http://adambrault.com/2013/05/08/then-you-should-do-it), a post by one of my favourite people in the world, [Adam Brault](http://adambrault.com).

What I&rsquo;m passionate about, what I&rdquo;d do even if I had to pay to do it, is writing software in a socially just way.

I&rsquo;m very privileged. I have a lot of power that I didn&rsquo;t really earn, at least no more so than many of those without power. I have a lot of freedom that I did nothing special to earn, freedom that is denied many of my peers.

And most importantly, I&rsquo;m in a position to shape, in very tangible ways, the world around me.

Software is not a panacea, software is not the end-all-be-all, and software cannot solve all our problems. But software sure as hell should not be perpetuating our problems. [But it is.](/posts/superhuman) Rather than equalizing, software [is polarizing](/posts/better).

People who can write software are becoming rich. They&rsquo;re doing it by selling out the people who can&rsquo;t write software.

[We need a revolution.](http://writing.jan.io/2013/08/16/lets-start-a-revolution.html)

None of this is new. I&rsquo;ve said this for a long time. A lot of people have said this for a long time, many of them more eloquently than I have.

The reason I bring it up is because this is what I desperately want to be doing. This is what comes gushing out when I talk to people.

I want to write open source software.

I want to have an [open company.](http://opencompany.org)

I want to [empower users, not constrain them.](http://indiewebcamp.com)

And for a while, I was [doing just that](/posts/2cloud). I learned how to write software and have a company and be responsible for users the hard way, by doing it.

And then I left college, and I went to work for [one company](http://iron.io) and now [another](http://www.dramafever.com), because I have student loans to pay and rent to pay. Because that&rsquo;s the easy way to do that. And because the companies are companies I love, companies I support. It wasn&rsquo;t selling my soul, it was an approximation of what I wanted that also put bread on the table.

But since then, I&rsquo;ve released nothing of substance on my own time.

Sure, I released [Wendy](http://secondbit.org/blog/introducing-pastry/), a Distributed Hash Table I wrote. It&rsquo;s buggy, not production-ready, and more or less abandonware at this point. As you can tell, I&rsquo;m very proud of it.

I released [Gets By](http://getsby.co), and I&rsquo;m tremendously proud of the individuals that contributed their stories. But let&rsquo;s be honest, all I did was hook up a [static site generator](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to Nginx and automate it with [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com). I did it in a weekend. I&rsquo;m proud of the people, not my software.

I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;working on&rdquo; the next version of 2cloud for, let&rsquo;s all count&hellip; _32 months_ now.

Let&rsquo;s talk about insane development cycles, shall we? Almost 3 years of iterating a single version on a product that is already in the hands of thousands of users. Who thought that was a good idea?

Well, nobody. I never _meant_ to do it.

And the guilt and shame eats at me.

In those 32 months, I&rsquo;ve gone through countless architectures, coding styles, and databases. Rewrite upon rewrite upon rewrite. I&rsquo;ve written more versions of 2cloud than the internet has written to-do list apps.

Why?

By all logic, I shouldn&rsquo;t be. I have users waiting for that software, users saddled with the buggy software of my yesteryears until I finish the new version. Why am I taking my sweet time in writing it?

_I&rsquo;m scared._

Terrified, petrified, anxiety-ridden. It haunts me and shapes me, this fear.

I&rsquo;m afraid, because until I release this update, it has potential. Once it is released, its potential is lost. It is now real; it is no longer _going to be_ something, it _is_ something. And I&rsquo;m not as good at [picking faults and tearing down](/posts/negative) things that are going to be. But once a thing is, it&rsquo;s fair game. All its unsanded edges, all its blemishes, I see them and can&rsquo;t ignore them.

And I know what the solution is, and that&rsquo;s what is so frustrating about this. The solution is to release it, and congratulate myself on the work I&rsquo;ve done, then go about sanding down the blemishes whenever I see them.

But first I need to get over that initial fear and actually ship something and call it &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;.

And what scares me, what terrifies me, is that a user will see the same blemishes and faults and failures I do, and they&rsquo;ll ask me about them. Even nicely. Even asking me why something works the way it does, why the user has to do more work than they should&hellip; that&rsquo;s terrifying.

But I can&rsquo;t just stop shipping things.

And this fear has bled over. I now have trouble shipping anything at all. My Github repos are tombstones of half-finished projects, ideas that are fully-formed and partially implemented.

Because that&rsquo;s what is safe.

But I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m so tired of not shipping anything. I&rsquo;m tired of talking about what things _will_ be, knowing they likely never will _be_.

I&rsquo;m tired of being afraid.
