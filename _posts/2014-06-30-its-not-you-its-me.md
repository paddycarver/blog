summary: "I&rsquo;m leaving Twitter for the month of July."

So here&rsquo;s the thing. I used to really, really love the casual connectedness of the Internet. I used to really, really love just speaking into the abyss and making friends when people replied.

The operative word is &ldquo;used to&rdquo;.

It has stopped being fun. It has started being work. It leaves me feeling drained, not invigorated.

This could be the fault of _Kids These Days&trade;_. It could be that _Twitter is evil_. It could be that I&rsquo;m becoming a bitter old man (I _do_ turn 24 this month&hellip;)

But here&rsquo;s the thing: I don&rsquo;t care anymore. I really, honestly, with all my heart, could not care less about which of those statements, if any, is true.

And when I don&rsquo;t care, it&rsquo;s time to step away.

So I&rsquo;m going to step away for the month of July. I&rsquo;m uninstalling Twitter on my phone. I&rsquo;m blocking it on my computers.

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I love the people I&rsquo;ve met there. If we exchange @mentions even infrequently, or even if we exchanged them once, this is not a slight on you, nor a desire for you to stay away. I sincerely hope you will email me, text me, write love letters in my HTTP Referer logs, _knock on my goddamn door_, and otherwise stay in touch. I&rsquo;ll still be on XMPP. I&rsquo;ll still hop on Freenode infrequently. I&rsquo;ll still answer email, and I still want to see you.

The people I&rsquo;ve met are the reason something like this will be hard, because I rely on them for inspiration and courage and hope and smiles. I rely on _you_ for these things.

But the scales have finally tipped, and it&rsquo;s become a net negative in my life. So it is time for it to go.

In the meantime, I might end up blogging more frequently here. Subscribe if you haven&rsquo;t and you want to stay up to speed.

I&rsquo;ve also decided I am going to, at long last, start working on Tangles, a blogging project I&rsquo;ve wanted to get going for, quite literally, years now. It will be running at [tangles.paddy.io](http://tangles.paddy.io) and will eventually become this blog, once I get the software to a stable enough state. I&rsquo;ll post updates here if I get it going in the next month, but no promises.

I&rsquo;m planning to implement the blocks and uninstalls when I wake up July 1st. Make sure we swap contact information by then.

I&rsquo;ll see you all soon. Please be here when I get back. Please come find me while I&rsquo;m gone.

Hugs always,  
Paddy
