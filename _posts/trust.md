I believe there are two types of trust.

The first is trust in the human. In this situation, the more relatable, 
the more flawed, the more _human_ someone appears to be, the more we 
trust them. It's why I'm trusted as a developer.

The second is trust in the unknown. In this situation, the more foreign, 
unfamiliar, unrelatable, and super-human or invincible someone seems, 
the more you trust them. They are a constant. This is why cloud computing 
works.
