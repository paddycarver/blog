When I was hired by [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io), they hired me as a 
intern Software Engineer. I was applying for a position that was 
originally meant to be for a full-time Software Engineer, but I asked 
if I could be an intern instead, as I still wasn't confident in my 
engineering abilities. I'm still not.

While I am working on some software engineering tasks, I feel like the 
title isn't a good representation of what I do. I also help out with 
marketing, for example. And I think my biggest contribution to the 
company, to date, has been documentation and developer advocacy.

These are not areas I've had much experience in, but they're things I 
have found I enjoy immensely. When we made the decision that our old 
documentation needed to be retired (I prefer "euthanised" or "shot in 
the face and then burned to be 100% sure it never returns"), I started 
to get more serious about researching the fledgling field of developer 
experience.

There's not a lot there. The most useful resource I can point you to is 
[Pamela Fox](http://www.pamelafox.org)'s [Developer Support Handbook](http://developer-support-handbook.org), 
which she documented her experience at Google in.

Matt Cutts, of Google's spam-fighting team, said that being able to code 
is akin to having a superpower in today's society. And he's right. It is 
becoming increasingly obvious that developers are a desired asset in 
pretty much every corner of our society today.

But every Batman needs an Alfred, and every developer needs a developer 
advocate. Alfred doesn't give Batman new powers or enhance his powers in 
any way; rather, Alfred's purpose is to give Batman more time to use his 
powers, by removing unecessary and mundance time-sinks that Batman would 
have had to deal with.

When I realised this, I started measuring the work we were doing at Iron 
in our developer support. I wasn't measuring based on the lines of code 
that developers produced, I wasn't even measuring based on the usage our 
platform got. Developers, like Batman, have really only one job: to kick 
ass. So I started measuring how long it took developers to kick ass using 
our system, and tried to decrease that time in whatever way I could. And 
so a new unit of measurement was born: Ass Kicked Per Minute.

At first, we could gain huge improvements in our Ass Kicked Per Minute 
scores. Things like refactoring our navigation to be more intuitive. We 
had a golden rule: if I can't get where I want to be in two clicks, it's 
wrong. We rewrote a lot of our documentation from scratch, focusing on 
completeness and accuracy. While we do have a [public support chatroom](http://www.hipchat.com/gNWgTiqIC), 
I regard every developer that winds up there as a developer I've failed. 
My next goal is to declare war on scrolling; scrolling is an imprecise, 
wasteful navigational technique, and the less users have to do it, the 
better. This means `position: fixed` is my friend.

But now our Ass Kicked Per Minute scores need to be fought for. Maybe 
we can only shave a half of a second off a common task. It's absolutely 
still worth doing, because that's a half a second that criminals are 
taking purses from little old ladies, otherwise.

I get to stand in front of a room full of [amazing college students](http://www.ubhacking.com) 
in a couple weeks and talk to them about our products. And when I introduce 
myself and explain what I do, I have every intention of being honest: 

<blockquote>"I spend a whole lot of time trying to save you a few seconds. 
And it is the best possible use of my time."</blockquote>
