My name&rsquo;s Paddy. I live in Richland, Washington with my [fianc&eacute;](https://twitter.com/carver_ethan) and [our puppy](https://twitter.com/RoxyThePuppy). I write software, give [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks), and inflict my [opinions]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts) on anyone who will listen.

I started the [gets by](http://getsby.co) project because I think mental illness is something we should talk about.

I wrote [Your API Is Bad](http://yourapiisbad.com) because I have a lot of feels about API design, and enough people listened to me about them that I figured it made sense to put them in a book. It&rsquo;s a work in progress, and released under a Creative Commons license. You can buy it from me at whatever price you like.

I&rsquo;ve been told that I&rsquo;m overly idealistic and have been accused of being an impractical zealot. I&rsquo;m at peace with these designations.
